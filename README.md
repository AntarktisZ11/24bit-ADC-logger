- Use two (2) 18650 batteries to keep it simple and battery charging easy to do separate without having to design new charger.

- 3D print battery holders keep design quick and inexpensive.

- Only use linear voltage regulator to keep design reliable and simple, all whilst improving measuring precision and accuracy.

- Input impedance should be high (>500 kΩ) to avoid affecting the device-under-test (DUT).

- Only have one measuring channel, keep usage simple to avoid unintended DUT interference.

- All test leads should be twisted pair and kept short to decrease differential mode interference.

- Max voltage should be around ±60 V

- Announce measurement via MQTT
